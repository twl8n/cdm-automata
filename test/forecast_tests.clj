  ;; With deps.edn, you can do this: clj -A:test -m forecast-tests
  ;; info-metric requires 2 positive inputs because of the symmetry of (abs(log (/ a b))) both orderings of start and end will have the same output.
  ;; Its sensible to return 0 for invalid inputs since the system should register that as no information offered and do nothing as a result
  ;; from a UI perspective validating inputs to cleanse zeros and negatives is a good idea.
